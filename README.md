# C_Assembly

>### Problem 1: [Using loops, branching and arrays]
Write a pure C program and the corresponding assembly program that gets the minimum
element in an integer array of size 10 and prints a message with the minimum number.

Deliverables:
- min.c 
- min.asm



>### Problem 2: [Using loops, branching and arrays]
Write a pure C program and the corresponding assembly program that counts the
number of even elements in an integer array of size 10 and prints a message with the
result.
 
 Deliverables: 
- count.c 
- count.asm



>### Problem 3 [Using loops, branching and arrays]:
Write a pure C program and the corresponding assembly program that calculates the
average of elements in an integer array of size 10 and prints a message with the average.
 
 Deliverables: 
- average.c 
- average.asm
